The code for this work is contained in 'CO-AMORE-Module.ipynb'. The additional files are the full isoprene mechanism and two reduced mechanisms that can be optimized. 
The main code is currently set up to run an isoprene mechanism optimization with the given files. 
If a new mechanism is being tested, be sure to follow the same formatting as is done in the Isoprene Setup section.
